# Running the client

1. Git clone the client on the current branch. For example, in the time when these instructions were written, the client was on the `feature/pages` branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mipar52/pra-project-internal-banking.git -b feature/pages
```

2. When you've cloned everything, cd to the `react-client-internal-banking` folder, and run `npm install`
3. When all of the packages are installed, run npm run dev -- --host

- This will give you the address of where the client is hosted (something with `localhost`).
- You can also run the client on your mobile device by entering the address in your mobile browser. Just make sure you're on the same network.
